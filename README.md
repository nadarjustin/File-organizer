# File-organizer
Sometimes while importing photos/videos/docs from phone, they are organized according to it's date of creation in thousands of folders.So it becomes difficult to go through all the pics/music/docs or any other file that's present in those folders at once.

So I wrote this code that will move the files from all those folders, rename them numerically and store theem in a single folder so that it's easy to go through all of them at once

Add the path to the folder that you want your files to be transferred to in "paths" variable
path to the main folder that contains those thousands of folders in "path" variable and in os.walk in line 5
and finally mention the type of file present in those folders. For e.g. .jpg,.mp4,.mp3 etc

Updates in this code to make it easier would be appreciated.

Thank you.
